Over the preceding decade, a notable increase has been seen  In the occurrence of established 
risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases within the developing countries having 
major populous countries  including China and India. This prevelance has led to a rise in the 
incidence of coronary and cerebrovascular events. As a response to  this escalating health 
challenge (Celermajer et al.), The purpose of this project is to design a non-invasive, computer
assisted diagnostic tool so that precise identification of coronary heart disease (CHD) could be 
made. Although invasive coronary angiography is regarded as the gold standard for CHD 
diagnosis, It entails substantial expenses and is linked to notable risks.  Currently used non
invasive approaches, like exercise electrocardiograms and thallium scintigraphy, have 
diagnostic accuracies that are constrained, ranging from 35% to 75% (Janosi et al., 1988). 
In this endeavor, researcher aims to address the limitations and challenges  by utilizing a dataset 
of 303 observations, that includes data from multiple non-invasive tests and patient details. 
Through the application of a logistic regression model, we attained an accuracy of 89%. To 
further refine the modelâ€™s performance, we used one-hot encoding to categorical data, 
facilitating better interpretation and use of these variables. The ultimate aim is to enhance 
diagnostic accuracy and provide a safer, non-invasive substitute to current diagnostic 
techniques.    

# Dataset Description
The collection of data on coronary diseases applied in this research originated from the 
Cleveland Clinic Foundation commonly known as the Cleveland dataset. This dataset was 
augmented by incorporating additional heart disease datasets to strengthen its robustness. The 
integrated data underwent normalized and scaled to ensure uniformity and enhance the efficacy 
of machine learning models during the process of training.
